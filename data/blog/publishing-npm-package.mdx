**Introduction**

Isn't it cool if you can run a command like `npx <your_name>` in someone’s terminal, and they instantly get access to your portfolio, your works, or social handles — right from the CLI?

Or maybe you've built a dope React component. Wouldn't it be even cooler if other devs could use it just by installing it from npm?

That’s the power of open-source and npm — and yes, it’s ridiculously simple to get started!

> Before diving into the how-to, try these in your terminal: `npx karthikmudunuri` or `npx get-response` — just to see what "cool" looks like.

## 🚀 Create your NPM account

Go to [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com) and sign up for a free account. Don’t skip 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) — it keeps your packages safe. Use an app like [TOTP Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authenticator.authservice2&hl=en&gl=US&pli=1) for better security.

---

## 🧠 Pick a Package Name

This must be unique! Visit the [NPM Registry](https://www.npmjs.com/) and search your desired name to make sure it's available.

If it’s already taken, get creative — maybe add a prefix or use a scoped package (`@yourname/package`).

---

## ⚒️ Start Building the Package

### ✅ Install Node.js and NPM

If Node isn’t installed yet, head to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and install the latest LTS version. You’ll get `npm` bundled with it.

### ✅ Initialize Git

Create a project folder:
```bash
mkdir my-package && cd my-package
git init
```

---

### ✅ Initialize NPM

```bash
npm init
```

Answer the prompts:

- **name**: lowercase, hyphenated name.
- **version**: start with `0.1.0`
- **description**: what your package does
- **entry point**: usually `index.js`
- **keywords**: optional
- **license**: use default `ISC`

Add this manually to `package.json`:

```json
"type": "module"
```

---

## **✍️ Write Your Code**

Create `index.js`:

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

console.log(
  "Follow karthikmudunuri on GitHub: https://github.com/karthikmudunuri"
);
```

> That first line allows execution from CLI using `npx`.

---

## **🧪 Add Executable Command**

In `package.json`, add:

```json
"bin": {
  "test": "./index.js"
}
```

Your full `package.json` should look like:

```json
{
  "name": "test",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "just to test how to publish npm package",
  "main": "./index.js",
  "type": "module",
  "bin": {
    "test": "./index.js"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git+https://github.com/karthikmudunuri/test.git"
  },
  "author": "Karthik Mudunuri",
  "license": "ISC",
  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/karthikmudunuri/test/issues"
  },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/karthikmudunuri/test#readme"
}
```



## **🔐 Make it Executable**

### Linux/macOS:

```bash
chmod +x index.js
```

### Windows (via Git Bash):

```bash
git update-index --chmod=+x index.js
```

---

## **🧪 Test Locally with `npm link`**

Run:

```bash
npm link
```

Test globally outside the project:

```bash
npx test
```

---

## **📦 Publish to NPM**

Login:

```bash
npm login
```

Publish:

```bash
npm publish
```

Now your package is live! 🎉

Visit [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/test) (replace `test` with your package name).

---

## **🔄 Update Your Package**

1. Bump version in `package.json`:

```json
"version": "1.1.0"
```

2. Re-publish:

```bash
npm publish
```

Make sure to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

---

## **✅ Conclusion**

Now you’ve published an NPM package that can be installed and run from anywhere in the world. Whether it’s a React component or a personal CLI — you’ve contributed to open source.
